# Cardiovascular Health Assessment and Risk Prediction Model 🩺📊🫀

🔍 **Overview:**
The task of predicting the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)🫀⚕️⚠️ using a dataset from an ongoing cardiovascular study conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset comprises demographic, behavioural, and medical risk factors for over 3390 individuals, with a total of 16 attribute variables. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient is at risk of future CHD based on these factors. Given the prevalence of heart diseases and their impact on public health, this project holds significant importance in the realm of preventive healthcare.🩺

🎯 **Objective:** 
To predict if someone is at risk of getting heart disease within the next 10 years.It's all about classification!
